---

## Description
- start date: 2021.05.07
- project: Build a blockchain based chat server using flask/python
- motive: Understand the core technology of blockchain and network communication via implementing the project.

## Plan

### phase1: centralized blockchain server
Message commuication server which data is stored in blockchain strucuture. But they will exist in a certain database.

1. blockchain implementation
    2. add message field
2. build message communication server w/ flask

### phase2: decentralized blockchain server
Message communication server which data is stored in blockchain structure and thy will exist in distributed nodes.

- Client node discovery
- protocol documentation
- merkle tree

### phaes3: decentralized blockchain chat server
- build chat server w/ socket and simple react.
- solve the problem of heavy/slow data flow
- solve the problem of synchronization
